## Description

JustBe is a mobile application that allows users to store all of their medical information in one centralized location. With JustBe, you can easily keep track of your health records, medications, and recent medical encounters. JustBe also offers a unique feature that allows you to earn money by sharing your medical information with researchers. By opting-in to this program, you can help advance medical research while also earning cryptocurrency for your participation. With JustBe, you can take control of your health and even earn money in the process.

## Features

### **Account Creation**

To create an account with JustBe, users will need to provide their email address, password, full legal name, phone number, and date of birth. This basic information is used to create an account and store user's personal and medical information.

Once the account is created, users will be prompted to complete their profile on the home page. Users will see a notification on their home screen that will direct them to enter their allergies, medications, and recent medical encounters. This information is necessary to provide a complete medical history and to make it easy to share information with healthcare providers.

### **Centralized Storage of Medical Data**

After creating an account, patients can easily enter their allergies, including the severity of the reaction, and list their current medications, including dosage, frequency, and date prescribed. They can also add the names, locations, and contact information for their medical providers, as well as information about recent medical encounters, including location, the name of the medical provider, and any other relevant details about the visit. 

By providing this information, patients can have a complete medical history stored in one centralized location, making it easy to share with healthcare providers and ensure that they receive the best possible care.

## Future Plans

JustBe centers around updating patients’ balance through cryptocurrency rewards, allowing patients to upload their own medical documents, and to expand display of a user’s medical information within the application. 

To fully implement the option for user’s to be able to earn money for their medical data, we would need to be able to update the wallet page for when their data has been sold. Although we have connected the marketplace, we still need to update users. This would also include a more transparent process for earning cryptocurrency by listing these transactions through a history.

Improving the entry of medical information for user’s would also be a valuable tool. Plans included to allow patients to scan a document with their phone and be able to store that data automatically, rather than the current process.

Lastly, although patients can currently enter and store their medical information, we do not have a full display of this information for users themselves. It is important that this information is easy to access and displayed simple enough to understand. A re-designed page on a patients profile would be the next step for this plan.
