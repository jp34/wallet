### Description

This project aims to accomplish two main tasks;
To create a secure, permissions-based application capable of storing patient healthcare information,
and provide uniform and complete medical documents to disease state researchers.

### Goals
1. Retain and manage patient healthcare information in a secure, permissions-based application.
2. Serve as a digital assistant to ensure the patient is collecting all the information from their provider to make their wallet accurate and complete.
3. Maintain complete medical records with well-defined data points for disease state research.
4. Connect researchers with patients that meet specific disease state criteria using blockchain technologies to ensure patients are giving consensus for their data to be used.
