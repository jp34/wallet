# Vision

The Healthcare Wallet provides a secure and centralized platform for patients to store and manage all of their medical information. Currently there lacks a concise way for patients to record and keep track of their healthcare visits and diagnoses in a system they can easily access. This product seeks to change that by enabling users to regain control of their personal information, and even earn money by anonymously sharing it with disease researchers.

# Mission

We aim to deliver a mobile application that acts as a patientâ€™s point of control over their data. Our app will allow users to upload, view, and share their information with healthcare professionals. Using blockchain technology we can allow users to earn money by anonymously selling their data. Their information will become available to medical researchers and contribute to important and life-saving research.
