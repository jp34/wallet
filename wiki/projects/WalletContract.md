## Description

The Blockchain portion of the Healthcare Wallet Project is a project folder named ‘wallet-contract’ containing the necessary code to deploy, test, and interact with the lazyNFT smart contract. This solidity contract features the ability to mint NFTs from vouchers before storing both the NFT metadata and the ether payment within the contract itself for the buyer and seller to retrieve respectively. The wallet-contract project folder also contains a javascript class for deploying the contract and another for interacting with the contract. Finally, the project folder has a test folder with two files meant to test both the class objects and the contract directly.
